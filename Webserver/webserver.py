'''
This webserver keeps track of users in queue for a charging station, and which charging stations are avaliable and reserved. 

Setup in MQTTX for solo testing:
* Subscribe to the topics in MQTTX: 
* "server/assigned_station/#"
* "server/wait_time/#" 
* "server/station_reserved/#" 

* Publish in MQTTX to the topics: 
* "phone/book_station/#"
* "phone/cancel_booking/#"
* "station/connection/#" 

In Mosquitto:
I'm running localhost as the broker for induvidual testing.

Python script:
* You only need to start the run and then do the rest in MQTTX.
