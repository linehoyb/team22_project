'''
This emulates an electric car, mainly the charging and draining of the battery.

Setup in MQTTX for solo testing::
* Subscribe to the topic "car/battery/#" to see the current car info.

* Publish to the topic "car/request_info" to get the updated car info
* Publish to the topic "station/connection" with the msg 1 or 0 to tell the car if it is connected to the
* charging station or not.

In Mosquitto:
I'm running localhost as the broker.

Python script:
* You only need to start the run and then do the rest in MQTTX.
